            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a graduate student at Northeastern University pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, 
              with an expected graduation date of 2026. I previously earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from 
              Northeastern in 2025.</p>

            <p>I am a passionate and versatile computer science student with a strong foundation in programming languages, 
              including C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. I have diverse interests across various fields of CS, including 
              Machine Learning, Software Development, Cybersecurity, Systems, and Infrastructure. I am excited to apply my knowledge 
              and experiences from both the workplace and academia to real-world challenges.</p>

            <p>I’m currently working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at GoLinks, where I’m contributing to an AI-powered web application. 
              My work spans both front-end and back-end development using JavaScript, React, and PHP, with additional experience in SQL, AWS, 
              Git, and GitHub.</p>

            <p>In my previous role as a Software Engineer at InteleTravel, I led a project to capture and analyze company education data using 
              PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and AWS integration. I worked with SQL Server and REST APIs, and gained valuable experience attending 
              the company’s annual tech conference. This deepened my knowledge in areas like Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, and Infrastructure, 
              while strengthening my collaboration and adaptability in agile environments.</p>

            <p>Earlier, I worked as a Quality Assurance Tester and Analyst for the New England Journal of Medicine, a prestigious publication by 
              the Massachusetts Medical Society. In this role, I worked with a team to ensure the functionality and usability of NEJM Healer, a 
              platform designed for medical professionals to practice clinical reasoning and decision-making. I used Java, Selenium, Cucumber, and 
              other tools to create and execute test cases, while also identifying and reporting bugs via Jira. I contributed to improving testing 
              processes and provided feedback to developers, enhancing both my problem-solving skills and my understanding of healthcare technology.</p>

            <p>Through these roles, I’ve demonstrated my attention to detail, creative thinking, communication skills, and my ability to quickly 
              adapt to new technologies. While my primary focus is in computer science, my work experiences have provided a unique perspective on 
              how technology can intersect with various fields.</p>
